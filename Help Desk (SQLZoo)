Scenario:
A software company has been successful in selling its products to a number of customer organisations, and there is now a 
high demand for technical support. There is already a system in place for logging support calls taken over the telephone 
and assigning them to engineers, but it is based on a series of spreadsheets. With the growing volume of data, using the 
spreadsheet system is becoming slow, and there is a significant risk that errors will be made.

Q: There are three issues that include the words "index" and "Oracle". Find the call_date for each of them.

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(call_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') AS call_date, call_ref 
FROM Issue
WHERE detail LIKE "%index%" AND detail LIKE "%Oracle%";

Q: Samantha Hall made three calls on 2017-08-14. Show the date and time for each.

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(i.call_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') AS call_date, c.first_name, c.last_name
FROM Issue AS i
JOIN Caller AS c ON i.caller_id = c.caller_id
WHERE c.first_name LIKE "%Samantha%" AND c.last_name LIKE "%Hall%" AND i.call_date LIKE "2017-08-14%";

Q: There are 500 calls in the system (roughly). Write a query that shows the number that have each status.

SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS Volume
FROM Issue
GROUP BY status;

Q: Calls are not normally assigned to a manager but it does happen. How many calls have been assigned to staff who are at 
Manager Level?

SELECT COUNT(call_ref) AS mlcc
FROM Issue AS i
JOIN Staff AS s ON i.assigned_to = s.staff_code
WHERE level_code IN (SELECT level_code
                     FROM Level
                     WHERE manager IS NOT NULL);

Q: Show the manager for each shift. Your output should include the shift date and type; also the first and last name of 
the manager.
